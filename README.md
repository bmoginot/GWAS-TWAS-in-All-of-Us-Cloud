# How to Do GWAS/TWAS in the All of Us Cloud Environment

## Using All of Us Cloud
### Get approved
In order to access sensitive All of Us GWAS data, you must create and account, verify your identity, and complete the requisite training. The steps to do this can be found in the wiki at [Registering for All of Us](https://github.com/bmoginot/GWAS-TWAS-in-All-of-Us-Cloud/wiki/1.-Registering-for-All-of-Us).

### Create Workspace
The next step is to create a workspace at your Research Workbench. Your workspace will house any GWAS data you pull along with all scripts from this repository and their output. The [Workspaces](https://github.com/bmoginot/GWAS-TWAS-in-All-of-Us-Cloud/wiki/2.-Workspaces) page on the wiki details how to set up a workspace.


## Using the pipeline
### Clone Repo
To access these scripts, clone this repository in your workspace. Information on how to do this and how to run scripts from this repo in your workspace is also in [Workspaces](https://github.com/bmoginot/GWAS-TWAS-in-All-of-Us-Cloud/wiki/2.-Workspaces).

### Analysis
Once these scripts are in your workspace, you will be able to run them to pull and analyze All of Us GWAS data. This can be done with the wrapper to run all analyses at once, or each tool can be run individually. Each tool is detailed in its respective wiki page; the wrapper is detailed below.
